##  1. Scope Definition

The scope section defines what the system is and isn’t, who it serves, and what boundaries or constraints govern it.
Think of it as the contract between stakeholders and the development team — setting the context for all requirement items.

### 1.1 Purpose

Describe:

* The system/product name
* Its primary mission or goal
* Intended audience and user groups
* Relationship to other systems or business processes

### 1.2 System Context

Define:
* System boundary (what’s inside vs. external)
* Interfaces (to other systems, services, or users)
* Actors & stakeholders (roles interacting with the system)

### 1.3 Scope of Functionality

List major functional domains or capabilities the system covers.

### 1.4 Scope of Performance / Quality Goals

Summarize quantitative system targets (non-functional dimensions).

Category     | Goal
--           | --
Performance  | Response time ≤ 2s for 95% of requests
Availability | ≥ 99.9% uptime
Scalability  | How many users (concurrent users) to serve
Security     | Compliance with ISO 27001 & data encryption in transit and at rest
Usability    | 80% of users can complete core tasks within 5 minutes of onboarding

### 1.5 Scope Exclusions

Explicitly state what is out of scope (to prevent misunderstandings).

## 2. Requirement Item Types
Your SRS should organize all requirements into distinct, traceable categories.
Each item should have a unique tag and be measurable or testable.

### 2.1 Functional Requirements (FR)

Describe what the system shall do. Captures functions, interactions, and behaviors.

**Functional Requirement Hierarchy**
 
Level | Description |  Example
--    | --                            | -- 
L1    | Mission Goal                  |  “Digitalize law enforcement workflows”
L2    | Function Group / Capability   | “Case Management”
L3    | Feature / Function            | “Create Case”
L4    | Functional Requirement        | “System shall generate a unique Case ID”
L5    | User Story                    | “Implement Case ID generator”

#### 2.1.1 Function Group / Capability
A Function Group (or Capability) is a logical cluster of related functions that collectively deliver a distinct business outcome or system service.
It sits between high-level business objectives and individual functional requirements, serving as the bridge between “why” and “what.”

You can think of it as a module of system purpose, not yet implementation detail.

#### 2.1.2 Feature (or Function) 

A Feature (or Function) is a distinct, deliverable system behavior or service that provides measurable value to a user or stakeholder.
It is the smallest functional unit that can stand alone as a valuable capability, but it can still be decomposed into multiple functional requirements (FRs) or user stories for implementation.

#### 2.1.3 Functional Requirement

A Functional Requirement defines a specific behavior, function, or service that a system or component shall perform in order to fulfill its intended purpose.
It specifies what the system must do — not how it does it — in terms that are complete, testable, and unambiguous.

Functional Requirements translate the “what” of a feature into explicit, measurable, implementable statements.

They:

* Define system behavior under specific conditions.
* Serve as the foundation for design, development, and testing.
* Ensure that every feature is fully described and traceable to user or business needs.

#### 2.1.4 User Story

A User Story is a short, structured statement that describes a user’s goal or interaction with the system in order to deliver a specific piece of business value.

It expresses who the user is, what they need to do, and why it matters — forming the bridge between the functional requirement (what the system must do) and the implementation (how developers will deliver it).
