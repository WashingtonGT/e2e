# Summary
Business scenarios are an important technique that may be used at various stages of the
enterprise architecture, principally the Architecture Vision and the Business Architecture.

A business scenario describes:
- A business process, application, or set of applications that can be enabled by the architecture
- The business and technology environment
- The people and computing components (called ‘‘actors’’) who execute the scenario
- The desired outcome of proper execution

A good business scenario is also **SMART**:
- **Specific**, by defining what needs to be done in the business
- **Measurable**, through clear metrics for success
- **Actionable**, by:
  - Clear ly segmenting the problem
  - Providing the basis for determining elements and plans for the solution
- **Realistic**, in that the problem can be solved within the bounds of physical reality, time, and cost constraint
- **Time-bound**, in that there is a clear statement of when the solution opportunity expires

# Overall Process

1. Identifying, documenting, and ranking the **problem** driving the scenario
2. Identifying the **business and technical environment** of the scenario and documenting it in
scenar io models
3. Identifying and documenting **desired objectives** (the results of handling the problems
successfully);
4. Identifying the **human actors** (participants) and their place in the business model
5. Identifying **computer actors** (computing elements) and their place in the technology model
6. Identifying and documenting **roles, responsibilities**, and **measures of success per actor**; documenting the required scripts per actor, and the results of handling the situation
7. Checking for ‘‘fitness-for-pur pose’’ and refining only if necessary
