# Architecture Initial Phase

defining the scope, identifying the stakeholders, creating the Architecture Vision, and
obtaining approvals.

## Objectives
- Develop a **high-level aspirational vision** of the **capabilities** and **business value** to be
**delivered** as a result of the proposed enterprise architecture.
- Obtain approval for a **Statement of Architecture Work** that defines a program of works to
develop and deploy the architecture outlined in the Architecture Vision.

## Activities

### Create the architecture vision
Architecture Vision: describes how the **new capability** will meet the **business goals** and **strategic objectives** and
address the stakeholder concerns when implemented.

Architecture projects are often undertaken with a specific purpose in mind — a specific set of **business drivers**

key elements of the Architecture Vision — such as the enterprise mission, vision, strategy, and goals 
— have been documented as part of some wider business strategy or enterprise planning activity that has its own lifecycle within the enterprise.

The Architecture Vision provides a first-cut, high-level description of the **Baseline** and **Target Architectures**, covering the business, 
data, application, and technology domains. These outline
descriptions are developed in subsequent phases.

- Identifier stakeholders, concerns and business requirements
- Define Scope 


### Develope Business Secnarios


## Define Scope
Define what is inside and what is outside the scope of the Baseline Architecture and Target Architecture efforts
- The breadth of coverage of the enterprise
- The level of detail required
- The partitioning characteristics of the architecture
- The specific architecture domains to be covered (business, data, application, technology)
- The extent of the time period aimed at, plus the number and extent of any inter mediate time period
- The architectural assets to be leveraged, or considered for use, from the organization’s

Enter prise Continuum:
- Assets created in the enterprise
- Assets available elsewhere in the industry (other frameworks, systems models, vertical industry models, etc.

## Statement of Architecture Work

Purpose
The Statement of Architecture Work defines the scope and approach that will be used to
complete an architecture development cycle. The Statement of Architecture Work is typically the
document against which successful execution of the architecture project will be measured and
may form the basis for a contractual agreement between the supplier and consumer of
architecture services.

Typical contents of a Statement of Architecture Work are:

- Title
- Architecture project request and background
- Architecture project description and scope
- Over view of Architecture Vision
- Specific change of scope procedures
- Roles, responsibilities, and deliverables
- Acceptance criteria and procedures
- Architecture project plan and schedule
- Approval
