## Summary
- The system should clean defined objectives and intentions.  Which will guide the system toward the objectives and intentions.
- The system ability to solving the problem is involving over the time, based on the knowledge learned and experience.
- The system should have speech and language capability
- The system should have knowledge (memory) capability

## Use Case

### Software requirements

#### 1. Objective/Intention
create a well organized requirements documents, and keep tracking/refining the requirements. 


- The input is the collected information about the need, what are needed by all stakeholders (customers, partners, end users, internal operations, management, engineering teams)


### Opensource intelligence 

The system response to the any opensource information, and generate thoughts of research the infomration, and connecting the subject, and build the profile.



Your brain is responsible for the following functions:
Automatic behaviors like breathing, heart rate, sleep and temperature control
Fight-or-flight response (stress response)
Keeping your organs working as expected
Memories and emotions
Movements (motor function), balance and coordination
Sensory processing (vision, hearing, smell, touch and taste)
Speech and language
Thoughts and decision-making

What does the prefrontal cortex do?
The PFC guides many of your everyday skills. Some of its main jobs include:

Attention: Helps you stay focused and ignore distractions
Decision-making: Helps you think through choices and direct your behavior
Emotions: Allows you to understand feelings, show empathy and respond to rewards or punishments
Goal setting: Learns from past experiences to manage your actions instead of acting on impulse
Self-control: Stops you from reacting automatically and lets you choose better options
Working memory: Holds information for a short time so you can use it right away

Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC): Planning, problem-solving and working memory and helping you stay focused by filtering out distractions
Anterior cingulate cortex (ACC): Emotional regulation, making choices and switching between tasks (like changing from washing dishes to drying them) and controlling autonomic functions (like heart rate and blood pressure)
Medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC): Adjusting your behavior when rules change (like stopping at a yellow light instead of speeding up)
Ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC): Judging experiences as good or bad (like feeling happy when you’re with people you trust)
Orbitofrontal cortex (OFC): Making decisions and controlling impulses (like resisting the urge to eat a cookie right before dinner), and helping you judge visual cues by linking them to outcomes or rewards
