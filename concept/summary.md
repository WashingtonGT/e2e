# Introduction

Build a system which can simulate how brainworks. 

1. Process information
2. Make decisions
3. Solve problems

As the main external facing capability, the system also has ability for self learning including

1. orientent goals
2. accumlated experiences
3. develop habits
4. build up principles (policies and conditional response)
5. refine the domain knowledge and toolkit (skills)

# Assumptions

Business domain is defined for a giving use case. The defintions includes:

1. Input
2. Output
3. Domain knowledge, semantics, business rules
4. Object model and data structure
5. Toolset in the domain 


# Architecture Building Blockes

1. User interface:  to integrade with different use cases (actors)
2. Data Transport, Convert and Store
3. Reasoning Boilplate
4. Toolset (SCP)
5. Goal Seeking 
6. Preference
7. Terms and Domain Semantic Model
8. Agentic framework
